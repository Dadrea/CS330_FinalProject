# CS330_FinalProject

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I approach designing software?

I tend to approach software design in an incremental form. I want to be able to see my project take shape over time and I love to hit that compile button and see the new changes take effect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I was able to see something from my mind leap out onto the screen, I have very little artistic ablity so being able to do this was an amazing feat!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What design process did you follow for your project work?

I made several sketches of what I wanted the final rendition to look like but ultimately due to time constraints with my personal life/and work it came down to a lot of brute force and trial and error.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Planning and implementation with itterative growth can be carried forwward with me in the hopes that time management is improved.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I approach developing programs?

I approach them with an open mind and wait to see what comes out of my itterative approach. i want to see my program grow and shape before my eyes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I attempted to continually take the lessons from each week and bring them into my project. However, I often hit walls and went with a brute force method of design which is also why my code base is so large for this project.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did iteration factor into your development?

Highly. That is how I approach programing as a rule. If I had done it all at once I would not have been nearly as happy with the end result.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I learned a lot, I grew a lot and as I progressed through the course I could feel how I was developing the project changing. I was more confident in my abilities.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Honestly I dont know this course at the beginning made me question my degree path. I hated it and wanted to quit at every step until the last two weeks where everything just sort of feel into place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

It led me to reseaching true graphical engines such as Godot which I have begun working in. I value this expeiance but I dont see myself using OpenGL in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

It gives me the apility to conceptulize what I want to see as my final project and it lets me look at the code in a way that I had not been able to do before.
